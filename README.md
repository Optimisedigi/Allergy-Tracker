## Overview

**AllergyTrack** helps parents systematically track food introductions and reactions, building confidence in safe foods through a visual "brick chart" system. Each successful allergy-free trial adds a brick to your child's progress, creating a clear visual history of their food journey.

### Target Users
Parents and caregivers of babies and toddlers (typically 6-24 months) who are introducing solid foods and monitoring for potential allergic reactions.

### Core Purpose
- Track food trials with observation periods (default: 3 days)
- Log allergic reactions with detailed symptoms
- Visualize food safety progress through color-coded bricks
- Identify safe foods vs. potential allergens
- Share detailed reports with healthcare providers

## The Brick System

The brick chart is the heart of AllergyTrack's visual tracking system. Each trial creates a brick that tells the story of your child's food journey.

### Three Brick Types

#### üü¢ **Green Brick (Safe)**
- **When created**: Trial completed successfully with no reaction
- **Meaning**: This trial passed safely
- **Visual**: Green gradient background

#### üü† **Amber/Orange Brick (Warning)**
- **When created**: First reaction occurs AFTER food previously passed safely (1+ green bricks exist)
- **Meaning**: Caution - this food was safe before but now caused a reaction
- **Visual**: Amber/orange gradient background
- **Why it matters**: Indicates tolerance may be fluctuating; proceed with medical guidance

#### üî¥ **Red Brick (Reaction)**
- **When created**: 
  - First trial of a food results in a reaction (no green bricks yet)
  - Second+ reaction occurs after a warning brick
- **Meaning**: Confirmed allergic reaction
- **Visual**: Red gradient background

### Brick Logic Examples

**Example 1: Introducing Peanut Butter**
- Trial 1: Pass ‚Üí üü¢ Green brick
- Trial 2: Pass ‚Üí üü¢ Green brick
- Trial 3: Reaction ‚Üí üü† Amber brick (WARNING: was safe, now reacted!)
- Trial 4: Reaction ‚Üí üî¥ Red brick

**Example 2: Introducing Egg**
- Trial 1: Reaction ‚Üí üî¥ Red brick (immediate reaction, no safe history)
- Trial 2: Reaction ‚Üí üî¥ Red brick

**Example 3: Building Confidence with Carrot**
- Trial 1: Pass ‚Üí üü¢ Green brick
- Trial 2: Pass ‚Üí üü¢ Green brick
- Trial 3: Pass ‚Üí üü¢ Green brick
- Status: "Safe food" ‚úÖ

### Why the Warning System Matters

The amber/orange warning brick is crucial because:
1. **Tolerance can change**: A food that was safe can later cause reactions
2. **Important medical signal**: Helps doctors identify developing sensitivities
3. **Prevents false confidence**: Even "safe" foods need continued monitoring
4. **Data preservation**: Keeps full history instead of overwriting past successes

## Status Logic

AllergyTrack uses a sophisticated 9-state status system that evaluates cumulative passes and reactions:

### Status Progression

| Passes | Reactions | Status | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| 0 | 0 | Not tested | ‚ö™ | No trials yet |
| 1 | 0 | Passed once | ‚úì | First successful trial |
| 2 | 0 | Building confidence | ‚ÜóÔ∏è | Making progress |
| 3+ | 0 | Safe food | ‚úÖ | High confidence - safe |
| 1+ | 1 | Caution | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Mixed results - be careful |
| 0 | 1 | Possible allergy | üî∂ | First trial reacted |
| 0 | 2 | Likely allergy | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Two reactions, no passes |
| 0 | 3+ | Confirmed allergy | üö´ | Strong evidence of allergy |
| Any | 2+ | Likely allergy | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Multiple reactions detected |

### Priority-Based Evaluation

The status logic follows this priority order:
1. **Check reaction count first**: 3+ reactions = "Confirmed allergy"
2. **Check for mixed results**: Reactions + Passes = "Caution" or "Likely allergy"
3. **Check pass count**: 3+ passes = "Safe food", 2 passes = "Building confidence", 1 pass = "Passed once"
4. **Default**: No trials = "Not tested"

### Visual Representation

**Home Screen**: Each food card shows:
- Status text with appropriate icon
- Brick chart showing full history
- Pass/Reaction counter (e.g., "2 passes, 1 reaction")

**Reports Page**: Table format shows:
- Progressive brick display (builds up row by row)
- Status shown only on final row or when significant status is reached

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Create an account** using Replit authentication
2. **Add your baby's profile** (optional but recommended for multi-child families)
3. **Start tracking foods** from the dashboard

### Starting a Food Trial

1. Tap the **"+ Start New Trial"** button on the Home screen
2. Select a food from the common allergens list
3. The trial begins with a 3-day observation period
4. Monitor your baby for any reactions during this time

### Completing a Trial (No Reaction)

1. After the observation period, tap **"Complete Trial"** on the food card
2. A **green brick** is added to the chart
3. The food's status updates based on total passes
4. You can start another trial of the same food to build confidence

### Logging a Reaction

1. If your baby has a reaction, tap **"Log Reaction"** immediately
2. Select all applicable symptoms:

3. Choose severity level (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
4. Enter duration (e.g., "30 minutes", "2 hours", "1 day")
5. Add notes with specific details
