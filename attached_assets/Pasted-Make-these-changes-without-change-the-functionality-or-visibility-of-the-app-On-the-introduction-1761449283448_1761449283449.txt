FAQs ‚Äî Allergy Tracker for Bubs
1. What is Allergy Tracker for Bubs?

3. What kind of reactions can I track?
You can record common reactions like itchiness, rash, hives, swelling, vomiting, or irritability. You can also log notes about behavioural changes such as fussiness or sleep disturbance.

4. Can I share my baby‚Äôs allergy data via email?

The core features are free to use as we‚Äôre gaining feedback from parents. You can use it for free now.

9. Who created Allergy Tracker for Bubs?
Allergy Tracker for Bubs was created by parents who‚Äôve experienced the challenge of having a child with eczema when starting their solid food journey and the issue with identifying food reactions first-hand. It‚Äôs built with empathy, simplicity, and safety in mind to make life easier for families navigating food introductions.
