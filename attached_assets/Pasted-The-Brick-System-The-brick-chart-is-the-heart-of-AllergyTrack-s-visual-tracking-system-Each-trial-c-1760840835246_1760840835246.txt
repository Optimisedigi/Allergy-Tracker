The Brick System
The brick chart is the heart of AllergyTrack's visual tracking system. Each trial creates a brick that tells the story of your child's food journey.

Three Brick Types
ðŸŸ¢ Green Brick (Safe)
Given: A food trial is being logged
When: The trial completes successfully with no reaction recorded
Then: Create a green brick
Meaning: This specific trial passed safely
Visual: Green gradient background
ðŸŸ  Amber/Orange Brick (Warning)
Given: A food has previously passed safely (has green bricks)
When: A reaction occurs for the first time after previous safe trials
Then: Create an amber/orange brick
Meaning: Warning - this is the first reaction after the food was previously safe
Visual: Amber/orange gradient background
Important: Amber bricks reset the consecutive red brick counter
ðŸ”´ Red Brick (Reaction)
Given: A food trial is being logged
When: A reaction is recorded during the trial
Then: Create a red brick
Meaning: A reaction occurred during this trial
Visual: Red gradient background
Important: Red bricks count towards consecutive reactions for allergy determination
Status Logic (Based on Brick Patterns)
Confirmed Allergy
Given: A food has a trial history
When: 3 consecutive red bricks occur (amber or green bricks reset the counter) OR any moderate/severe reaction occurs
Then: Status = "Confirmed allergy"
If retesting: Status = "Confirmed allergy but testing again"
Safe Food
Given: A food has been tested multiple times
When: 3+ consecutive green bricks with NO reactions in entire history
Then: Status = "Safe food"
If retesting: Status = "Food is safe but testing again"
Safe Food, But Signs of Sensitivity
Given: A food has both passes and reactions in history
When: 3+ consecutive green bricks AND reactions exist somewhere in the food's history
Then: Status = "Safe food, but signs of sensitivity"
Visual: Orange warning icon (AlertTriangle)
Meaning: Currently passing safely, but has shown sensitivity in the past
Building Confidence
Given: A food is in early testing stages
When: Exactly 2 green bricks with no reactions
Then: Status = "Building confidence"
Passed Once
Given: A food is just starting to be tested
When: Exactly 1 green brick with no reactions
Then: Status = "Passed once"
Likely Allergy
Given: A food has multiple trials with reactions
When: 3+ passes with 2+ reactions (but not 3 consecutive red bricks)
Then: Status = "Likely allergy"
Caution
Given: A food has been tested multiple times with minimal reactions
When: 3+ passes with exactly 1 reaction
Then: Status = "Caution"
Allergy Suspected
Given: A food is in early testing with concerning results
When: Less than 3 passes with 2+ reactions
Then: Status = "Allergy suspected"
Possible Sensitivity
Given: A food is in early testing with a single reaction
When: Less than 3 passes with exactly 1 reaction
Then: Status = "Possible sensitivity"
Key Rules Summary
Consecutive Red Bricks: Requires 3 in a row for "Confirmed allergy" - any amber or green brick resets the counter
Consecutive Safe Bricks: Requires 3 in a row for "Safe food" status
Amber Brick Creation: Only created when a reaction occurs AFTER previous safe trials
First Brick: Always green (safe) or red (reaction) - never amber
Brick Order: Displayed newest first (most recent trial appears first)
Sensitivity History: System tracks past reactions even when food is currently passing
